# Bracket for coralling desktop chargers
I have a few two way radios and the chargers are pretty light and slide around under my desk. I'd like to be able to temporarily attach them to a board or some other surface to organize cables and get them up off the floor.

I'd like to 3d print these brackets as a flexible system for this kind of task. These are designed around a Baofeng charger but I imagine they'd work for anything kind of similar shaped. We'll see how version one goes!
